# Introduction

As titled this is a Grimoire, a book of magical spells and incantations.

I chose the title Grimoire as it fits how so many deeply technical subjects to the uninitiated seem arcane.

All through elementary and middle school I was fascinated with fantasy novels, spending hours each day reading of heroines using spells to change their world.

My own desire to create led me to study engineering so that I could learn the practical spells to build the systems I wanted to see.

This Grimoire is a repository for the practical spells I have learned as a reference or myself and others on a quest to create.
