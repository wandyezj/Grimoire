# People Skills

Instead of calling out an individual call out the specific behavior to be corrected and mention that everyone is expected to do the correct behavior.

To get the measure of someones skills assign them a high level task, only stepping in to gently guide them if required. It's difficult to assess someone skills without a demonstration and it's hard to know what experience people have, so allow people the opportunity to demonstrate their skills so you can figure out what they are good at and what they need help with.
